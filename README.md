\## 📌 Project Overview



In today’s digital job market, fake job postings have become a widespread scam targeting students, freshers, and professionals. Our project, \*\*Smart Job Detector\*\*, is an AI-powered tool that uses machine learning and NLP to detect fraudulent job listings automatically.



Built in Python using \*\*Google Colab\*\*, this model analyzes job details and flags suspicious postings in real time—helping protect job seekers from data theft and financial loss.
